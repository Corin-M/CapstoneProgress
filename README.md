# Overview of Capstone Vision:
My project is expanding accessibility to video and VR social stories for individuals with autism and other social anxieties, through an online sharing platform with guides on creating social stories. A common intervention for individuals who feel distressed over new experiences, social stories are written or illustrated first-person narratives that inform the reader of the future events, expectations, rules, and potential triggers of the experience described by the story. However, the traditional format is of limited use due to the target audience’s general preference for visual learning and the written word’ inability to prepare individuals for the sensory components of the experience. Thus video and VR technologies are slowly being utilized, but these new technologies remain largely outside of the general population’s access. My project will increase accessibility by creating a single cohesive location to access and post social stories created by companies, individuals, and larger advocacy groups. It will also encourage more creators to make basic stories for their services and relevant experiences by providing a guide to creating multimedia stories in an effective format.
